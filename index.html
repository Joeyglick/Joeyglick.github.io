<p>I am currently a freshman at The University of Buffalo, studying computer science. On this website I will post random things that I like and would like all of the interent users to know. 
  Before I talk about random things I have done I feel it is appropriate to mention that I am in a dance class. As you will read later on my website,
  I am taking HON 214 which is the honors seminar. This is my dance class. I have never danced before but had an incredible amount of fun and learend a lot of dance.
  You might think I was waisting my time and didn't learn anything. However, I will leave a link to my portfolio to see what I did throughout the semester.
