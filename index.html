    <h1>Joseph's Web Page</h1>
    



<p>I am currently a freshman at The University of Buffalo, studying computer science. On this website I will post random things that I like and would like all of the internet users to know. 
  Before I talk about random things I have done, I feel it is appropriate to mention that I am in a dance class. As you will read later on my website,
  I am taking HON 214 which is the honors seminar. This is my dance class. I have never danced before but had an incredible amount of fun and learned how to dance.
  You might think I was wasting my time and didn't learn anything. However, I will leave a link to my portfolio so you can see what I did throughout the semester.
  </p>

  <h2> Here are some things I enjoy</h2>
<ul>
  <li> Frisbee</li>
  <li> Running</li>
  <li> Reading</li>
  <li> Long walks on the beach</li>
  <li> Vanilla ice cream </li>
  </ul>
  
<h3> This year I am taking several courses toward my major in addition to other classes. These classes include: </h3>
  
  <ul2>
    <li> CSE 199 - Computer Science Seminar</li>
    
    In this class, we discussed the different things you could do with the internet and how to use it.
   
    <li> CSE 115 - Intro to Computer Science</li>
    
    After taking this course, I now have an introductory level understanding of Java.
    
    <li> MTH 141 - Calculus I</li>
    
    Calculus I covered topics such as defining limits, taking derivitives, and integrating functions.
    
    <li> HON 214 - Art of Motion</li>
    
    <li> EAS 160 - Machine Shop</li>
    
    <li> CHE 107 - Intro Chemistry for Engineers</li>
    
  </ul2>

  <h4> The Future </h4>
  <p2> I am not sure what the future holds. As of now, I can only plan so much of it and do so much to follow the path I 
    desire. regardless of where I end up or what I end up doing I hope it is something I enjoy and will be able to make a 
    difference.
